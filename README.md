# inventory-application

Your Inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
